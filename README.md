# youtube-dl-ui
Made a simple UI with tkinter for youtube-ui

This is made so users can use this script without using the command line. It consists of simple options for the resolution and an input for a cookie txt file for age restricted videos.

How to use:

Add this whole folder into the youtube-di repository. You may find the repo here: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl

The exe file is blocked by Windows Defender which is falsely flagged. You may need to turn off Realtime Protection in order to use this.
