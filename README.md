# youtube-dl-ui
Made a simple UI with tkinter for youtube-ui

This is made so users can use this script without using the command line. It consists of simple options for the resolution and an input for a cookie txt file for age restricted videos.

How to use:

Download the youtube-dl repository. You may find the repo here: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl

Create a folder named "youtube-dl-ui" and add the files into the folder.

Run the bat script to start the UI

FAQ:

Q: The UI won't run.
A: This requires Python to run, you may download it here (please choose the latest stable version): https://www.python.org/downloads/

Q: The files are downloaded into two files separately as audio and video.
A: You need ffmpeg to convert both of them into the video as youtube API has them separate.
