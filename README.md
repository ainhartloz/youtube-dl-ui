# youtube-dl-ui
Made a simple UI with tkinter for youtube-ui

This is made so users can use this script without using the command line. It consists of simple options for the resolution and an input for a cookie txt file for age restricted videos.

How to use:

Download the youtube-di repository. You may find the repo here: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl

Create a folder named "youtube-dl-ui" and add the files into the folder.

Run the bat script to start the UI
